      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>This website will be a great place to talk about items spoken about our podcast, The 630 Remake. We speak about balancing spirituality and our ever-busy youthful, young adult lives. 
        In this case, this website will operate as a marketing tool and as a blog for powerful relevant conversations regarding my experiences on my mission in Cape Town, South Africa. Engaging in life lessons that I have learned from the experience and inspiring listeners to
        become the best versions of themselves. Enter into your element.
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>I want this site to be a relatable and relevant platform for youth and young adults who are experiencing diminished faith.
        I want people to discover an interest in their spirituality and answer questions and create a community of people that honour Christlike attributes.

        A media agency for the millennial, for you, for today
        Creativity is our love and attention is our passion
        Read full article

        We are a local creative and media agency that sees differently because we feel differently.
        Passion Unplugged
        A visual- and sound-forward, consumer-centric storytelling machine. We lean on the edge of the creative ideas of life we know our client needs. We work from the bottom up. We work to find what works for the end-consumer, more than what works for our client. We are a modern mix of your typical Johannesburg creative thinker of yesterday and social media influencer of today who believe a single Tik Tok post can be seen at a World Cup Final.
        Get it done. Not potential reach.
        We are unshakeably focused on one thing: achieving results and goals for brands. Whether it be a personal or commercial brand, we have a deep respect and empathetic wisdom of where consumers spend their time and how the consume their time. We will build modern planning systems that drive our clients to act. We are reverse engineering how consumers interact with brands by helping brands understand attention, relevance and growth.
        Being Human is our power
        We put human beings, and not social media platforms, first. We connect by understanding culture, tradition and the practicalities of consumer needs. Faith and love are always our #1 strategy
